The code was in bundled format. I don't needed so i used code in simple style.

1. But it does not work as expected (when I change scene it still shows hotspots) BUG. Show file index-not-working.html



File index.v1.html is modified in implementation but no change to library.
I want to use dropdown to change scenes because it confuses with button. As i want to try with 3-4 scenes as example.
This is cause some errors.

When user presses save-camera-rotation, it adds it to array scenes rotation

1. event switch-scene goes to center as my understanding says.

in Line 80 registry.js you calling

     this.el.emit("scene-latest", {
        hotspots: this.geoData,
        camRot: camRot,
        parentRot: parentRot
      });
	  
where is event listener scene-latest

i want to update my scene with latest rotation saved in scene array.
